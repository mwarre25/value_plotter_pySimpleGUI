# value_tool
Build a list of programs, a list of projects in the programs, a list of tasks in the projects and a list of respondent survey answers for any tasks. Survey answers are saved in a dataframe and then selectively exported, or plotted on a bubble chart (x-axis: Average Usability, y-axis: Average Value ) based on project.
